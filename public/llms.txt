# Laxman K R

AI Engineeer

## Bio
Hey, I’m Laxman, a full-stack developer who enjoys building modern, well structured apps where things just feel right from how the UI looks to how the code is organized under the hood.
I’m drawn to system design, application structure, and different programming paradigms, with `TypeScript` as my go to language and `Python` for AI-driven work. I prefer exploring new technologies instead of riding the same stack for so long.

## Work Experience

### Tata Consultancy Services
**AI Engineer & Platform Owner**
*November 2024 - Present*

- **Agentic AMS Framework**: Engineered an autonomous self-healing system integrating Grafana and ServiceNow. Developed AI agents capable of diagnosing incidents and executing SOP-driven remediations, resulting in a substantial reduction in Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
- **Microfrontend Migration**: Orchestrated the architectural transition of the TCS CBG AI platform to a microfrontend framework. This initiative decoupled core services, enabling independent development cycles and eliminating deployment bottlenecks across workstreams.
- **Platform Ownership**: Appointed as Deployment Lead for the TCS CBG AI platform, exercising full authority over release management and production environment stability.
- **Team Leadership**: Led the Platform and Frontend developer teams, synchronizing core development with operational requirements to ensure high-performance delivery and system resilience.
