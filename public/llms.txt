# Laxman K R

AI Engineeer

## Bio
Hey, I’m Laxman, a full-stack developer who enjoys building modern, well structured apps where things just feel right from how the UI looks to how the code is organized under the hood.
I’m drawn to system design, application structure, and different programming paradigms, with `TypeScript` as my go to language and `Python` for AI-driven work. I prefer exploring new technologies instead of riding the same stack for so long.
