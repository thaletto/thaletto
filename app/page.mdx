# Laxman K R

Focused on creating intuitive and performant web experiences.
Bridging the gap between design and development.

Since high school, I’ve spent years on algorithm competitions, web design and development. In 2017, I earned my BSc degree in Computer Science from Fudan University in Shanghai, and joined as a software engineer at Microsoft. In 2018, I joined Vercel (ZEIT) to help build the next generation of developer tools including the platform, Next.js, AI SDK, v0, and more.
