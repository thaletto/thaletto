# Lense

<Card image={metadata.image} />

Lense is an Android application for selling pre-owned products with AI-powered value estimation. It simplifies listing items by automatically generating descriptions and estimating product value using image classification and captioning models.

## Key Features

- Upload a product image and get AI-generated description.  
- Automatic value estimation for pre-owned products.  
- Smooth Android experience using **Jetpack Compose**.  
- Efficient image processing for fast results.

## How It Works

1. User uploads a product image.  
2. **EfficientNet (TensorFlow Lite 4)** classifies the product.  
3. **GPT-2 Image Captioning** generates a descriptive caption.  
4. The app returns the estimated value and a ready-to-post description.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose  
- **AI Models:**  
  - [EfficientNet (TensorFlow Lite 4)](https://www.kaggle.com/models/tensorflow/efficientnet/tfLite) via HuggingFace  
  - [GPT-2 Image Captioning](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning) via HuggingFace  

## Challenges & Learnings

- Integrating TensorFlow Lite with Kotlin for on-device inference.  
- Generating meaningful product descriptions with GPT-2.  
- Optimizing image processing for mobile performance.
