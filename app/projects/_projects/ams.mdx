> An **Agentic Application Management Services (AMS) Framework** designed to autonomously detect, analyze, and resolve production incidents using AI agents, while maintaining human oversight for critical actions.

## Problem Statement
Traditional incident management workflows rely heavily on manual triage, repetitive SOP execution, and delayed escalations, leading to higher MTTR and operational overhead.

## Solution Overview
The framework integrates **observability, ITSM, and agentic orchestration** to automate the complete incident lifecycle.

## Architecture & Flow
- **Grafana** monitors production systems and logs failures or anomalies  
- Alerts automatically create **ServiceNow incidents**  
- An **AI agent** listens to incoming ServiceNow tickets and ingests incident metadata  
- The agent follows predefined **SOPs or historical incident resolution good known steps**  
- Sensitive operations require **human-in-the-loop approval**, configurable per incident
- **Dynamic, real-time UI** synchronized with agent execution steps, providing full transparency and debugging
- Incidents are either **auto-resolved** or **escalated to L2 teams** when necessary by agent
- Also provides platform and tools for manual resolution

### Key Features
- End-to-end **agentic incident handling** from detection to resolution  
- Configurable **human approval gates** before executing production actions  
- Intelligent **fallback and escalation mechanisms**  
- Automated generation of:
  - **Post-incident reports**
  - **Leadership and executive summaries**
- Reduced MTTR by eliminating manual triage and repetitive operational tasks  

## Impact
- Improved operational efficiency and platform reliability  
- Faster incident resolution with consistent SOP execution  
- Enhanced visibility for leadership through automated reporting  

## Tech Stack
- AI & Orchestration: **Google ADK**, **Autogen**, **Langchain**, **AzureOpenAI**
- Backend & Integrations: FastAPI, Qdrant, MongoDB, Redis
- UI: Next.js, Material UI
- Monitoring: Grafana
- ITSM: ServiceNow
- Deployment: Jenkins, Docker
- Cloud Provider: Google Cloud  

This project demonstrates strong expertise in **agentic systems**, **production scale automation**, and **AI-powered operations engineering**.
