> ## Abstract
>
> Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with a low survival rate. Early detection using medical imaging is crucial. However, CT scans often fail to detect irregular or complex nodules. This project leverages deep learning V-Net, YOLOv5s, and DETR models combined with a shape modeling algorithm to accurately detect lung nodules and reduce misinterpretation.

## Problem Statement

Detecting lung nodules manually in CT scans is time-consuming and prone to errors. Nodules vary in size, shape, and location, which leads to high false-positive rates. Automated detection can improve radiologist efficiency, assist treatment planning, and enable remote diagnostics.

### Applications

- **Research & Clinical Studies:** Evaluate new treatments.
- **Treatment Planning:** Personalize care based on nodule growth and location.
- **Radiologist Assistance:** Improve workflow by handling routine detection tasks.
- **Telemedicine:** Enable remote, timely consultations.
- **AI Integration:** Combine with other AI models for comprehensive diagnosis.

### Challenges

- Variability in nodule characteristics (size, shape, density).
- High false positives causing unnecessary tests.
- Adapting models to new datasets from different scanners or hospitals.

## Proposed System

We designed a multi-model system:

### V-Net

A 3D convolutional neural network for volumetric segmentation.

- Accurately segments lung nodules of varying shapes and sizes.
- Uses residual functions and weighted learning for complex patterns.
- Input: CT scan images with corresponding masks.
- Output: Precise nodule segmentation.

### YOLOv5s

Real-time object detection model for nodule localization.

- Processes each CT slice as an individual image.
- Assigns probabilities to detected nodules in N×N grids.
- Integrates with V-Net for improved detection accuracy.

### YOLOv5s + Shape Modeling Algorithm

- Captures local shape features: compactness, eccentricity, solidity.
- Helps classify nodules as solid or ground-glass opacity.
- Reduces false positives by analyzing shape and intensity.

### DETR (Detection Transformer)

- Transformer-based model for refined object detection.
- Uses queries to detect nodules in images.
- Outputs class labels and bounding boxes using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

## Implementation

### Data Preparation

- **Resizing:** Images resized to 256×256 pixels to balance detail and computational efficiency.
- **Diagnosis Mapping:** Masks analyzed to mark presence of nodules (1 if present, 0 otherwise).
- **Data Splitting:** Train, validation, and test sets created using `train_test_split`.
- **Data Augmentation:** Rotations, flips, shear, zoom applied to improve generalization.

### Model Training

- **V-Net:** Encoder-decoder architecture with convolutional blocks, batch normalization, ReLU activations, and fully connected layers for feature extraction.
- **YOLOv5s:** Single-pass object detection for bounding box prediction.
- **DETR:** Transformer encoder-decoder for enhanced detection and localization.

## Results

## Conclusion

The multi-model approach combining V-Net, YOLOv5s, DETR, and shape modeling successfully detects complex lung nodules from CT scans. This system improves early detection, reduces misinterpretation, and supports radiologists in clinical settings.
