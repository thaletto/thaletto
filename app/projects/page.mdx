# Projects

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with talented teams on diverse projects, from open-source libraries to large-scale applications.

## [<Nextjs height={14} />](https://nextjs.org 'Next.js')

I have been a core maintainer of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) since 2020, collaborating closely with the React team to drive significant advancements. I led the development of Streaming SSR, Edge Runtime, React Server Components, Server Actions and other major architectural improvements in Next.js ([full list of contributions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ashuding+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-desc)). I also designed and implemented the Next.js website in [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181229212637/https://nextjs.org/).

## [<V0 height={14}/>](https://v0.dev 'Vercel v0')

I co-created [v0](https://v0.dev) with [Jared Palmer](https://jaredpalmer.com), [Max Leiter](https://maxleiter.com), and [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) in 2023. I helped design the application architecture and implemented multiple parts of the core AI and streaming & rendering pipeline. In 2024 I created Design Mode in v0.

## [<AISDK height={18}/>](https://github.com/vercel/ai 'Vercel AI SDK')

I designed the very first version of client-side hook APIs, implemented function calling, RSC and data APIs for [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/). Besides it, I also developed the initial [AI playground](https://sdk.vercel.ai/playground) and [documentation site](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs).

## [<Vercel height={14}/>](https://vercel.com 'Vercel')

I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com) in 2018 as one of the earliest engineers, and have been working on various projects since then. Notable work include:
[Fast Image Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images), [Analytics Visualizations](https://vercel.com/blog/curve-fitting-for-charts-better-visualizations-for-vercel-analytics), [Dashboard Performance Improvements](https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-made-the-vercel-dashboard-twice-as-fast), [Project-Level Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/git), [Custom Production Branch](https://vercel.com/blog/custom-production-branch), Usage Dashboard, Advanced Project Settings, Monorepo Pipeline, Deploy Button, Dashboard Redesign, etc.

## [<SWR height={13}/>](https://swr.vercel.app 'SWR')

I created [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) with [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com) in 2019 as the first hook-based, stale-while-revalidate data fetching library. Led its development for 5 years.

[Paco Coursey](https://paco.me) designed the delightful SWR logo.

## [<Satori height={18}/>](https://github.com/vercel/satori 'Satori')

[Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) is the first CSS-to-SVG render engine that does not rely on a browser environment. I created Satori in 2021 for Vercel’s [OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images) project.

Given the great balance between size, performance and compatibility, Satori has become the standard way of generating social cards in many popular Web frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/modules/og-image), [SvelteKit](https://github.com/etherCorps/sveltekit-og), [Astro](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/astro-opengraph-images), and many others.

## [<Nextra height={14}/>](https://nextra.site 'Nextra')

[Nextra](https://nextra.site) is one of the most popular Next.js based documentation solutions. Prior to Nextra, there is no good documentation solution for Next.js. I created it in 2020 and led the development of Nextra v2 in 2022, which powers many of my projects’ homepages.

## [<COBE height={18}/>](https://github.com/shuding/cobe 'COBE')

[COBE](https://github.com/shuding/cobe) is maybe the smallest (5kB) web 3D globe implementation, with a minimalistic style. I made it in 2021 to optimize Vercel’s homepage performance ([_story_](https://twitter.com/shuding/status/1475916082875666441)), and it seems to become a [popular](https://x.com/imRazvanBadea/status/1804626727601422681) choice for many websites.

## [<ReactWrapBalancer height={18} />](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app 'React Wrap Balancer')

[React Wrap Balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app) was created in 2022 to improve the typesetting of the Vercel blog, which was later ported to Vue and Svelte. I believe this library helped pushing forward the development of the CSS standard `text-wrap: balance`.

## [<NextViewTransitions height={18}/>](https://github.com/shuding/next-view-transitions 'Next View Transitions')

In 2024, I created [Next View Transitions](https://github.com/shuding/next-view-transitions) for Next.js as the View Transitions API is becoming stable.
