# How I stole the design of my portfolio

> Update: A major ui revamp happened in my portfolio, find the source code of version v1 [here](https://github.com/thaletto/portfolio-v1).

In the world of web development, there's a fine line between inspiration and imitation. And if I’m being honest, I’ve never been afraid to blur that line at least when it comes to learning.

This blog post is a confession of sorts. Not in the "I copied everything pixel for pixel" sense, but more of a love letter to the ideas, aesthetics, and creatives who pushed me to build something of my own. My portfolio website [thaletto.vercel.app](https://thaletto.vercel.app) isn’t a product of solitude and originality. It’s the outcome of standing on the shoulders of modern design giants and remixing their best ideas into a form that feels like... me.

## The Shapes

The structure of my site the layout, the geometry, the breathing space between sections was heavily inspired by [Julien Thibeaut](https://nim-fawn.vercel.app/).
When I first encountered his portfolio, I initially dismissed it as too simplistic. However, I soon realized that as a developer, my focus should be on showcasing the technical implementation rather than complex design elements. This epiphany led me to embrace a minimalist approach, allowing the underlying technology to take center stage.

He had generously made his design available as a template, check it out [here](https://vercel.com/templates/portfolio/nim-minimalist-personal-site)

## The Colors

Color is hard.

Like many developers, I’ve spent hours doom scrolling through color palettes that looked good in theory but didn’t _feel_ right in practice. I wasn’t looking for trendy, solid tones I was chasing colors that evoked something.

And right then, _Diabrowser_ was rolling out its general release. The browser company (which houses some ex Apple designers) had created something truly elegant with [diabrowser.com](https://diabrowser.com) and its sibling, [arc.net](https://arc.net). The subtle gradients, the interplay between soft light and muted shadows it gave me a baseline. A direction.

With the help of ChatGPT, a bit of experimentation, and countless refreshes later, I had curated a palette that felt balanced.

## The Art

Let me be honest design isn't my forte, and photo editing is even more challenging.
My approach to creating compelling visuals relies heavily on AI tools like ChatGPT, but even that requires a solid design foundation and reference points. I've been particularly drawn to Perplexity's marketing imagery, and it's a easy choice. You can find them at the [Perplexity Blogs](https://perplexity.ai.hub)

## The Truth

What I’ve built isn’t a design masterpiece. Forget masterpiece, it is a cheap copy of mix of great designs but this is a **practice ground**, a **sandbox**.

My portfolio is where I try out tech, mess with UI ideas, and mimic designs that inspire me not to replicate, but to **understand**. I believe that’s how you learn: you borrow, you bend, you break, and you build again.

So yes, I stole the design of this website. But in doing so, I found a design language of my own.

And I'm just getting started.
